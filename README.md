# About Me
  Yo! I'm a self taught (mostly) software developer, I attended college more than 20 years ago but sadly did not finish it.<br/>
It was not before the year of 2020 when COVID-19 stroke our world that I had a chance to get back to this programmer life through a Data Science Course that took me almost a year to complete. Until then, I was working on many unrelated jobs like nightclub cashier->manager,
wharehouse logistics assistant and surveillance operator for a security company, to name a few.
After that course, a friend appointed me for a job at a startup company and I landed a position of backend developer for a little more than a year. That time was really challenging for me but also a great learning oportunity, so I've been studing and trying to learn as much as I can, about all things related to software development. It's a long road and I still have a lot to learn about so many things.

  Right now I'm trying to develop some kind of pet finder system, even if there are many of these around, mostly to learn more about fullstack development. I intend to use React to implement the frontend and create an API with .NET to act as the backend. It is still pretty early on development but I may have some changes to add to this in a short.

  Well, right now I'm learning React as Frontend development is something quite new to me. I've used .NET MAUI to create a weather forecast application and had a crash course on angular but, seeing as I know very little on javascript (and typescript for that matter), I decided to use React to help me get a little better with this. Hopefully it will become clearer as I work with it. I have a couple of other courses running, most of them directly related to software development and engineering (like DDD, CQRS, Event Sourcing, Software Testing, etc.).
